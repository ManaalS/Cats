# Cats
Project #2 for CS61A - Fall 2019 

In this project, I wrote a program that measures typing speed. Additionally, I implemented typing autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. This project was the second project for CS61A, a course in Python.
